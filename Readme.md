## StructData
### Lightweight Framework for using Core Data with Structs

> Status, in Development

This is a framework to use core data with struct models instead of NSObject-based classes. Serialization struct -> NSManagedObject already works (if a bit rough), however the other way around is still work in progress with a lot of thinking but no feasible code yet..

### Todo
- [ ] Add query methods to query from core data straight into structs
- [ ] support more types, including NSData, NSDate, and transformable (NSValue)
